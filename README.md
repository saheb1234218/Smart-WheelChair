# Smart-WheelChair
Designed a smart wheelchair to help the paralyzed people as well as the old people who require help even to move from place to place.
With this system they can travel without much hesitation just with the help of your hands with gestures.
I have used here Arduino UNO R3 with a ADXL335 accelerometer and L293D motor driver for the makeover of the model.
with the acccelerometer user can move it any direction and with the values recieved by the sensor we can compute the motor drivers to move in which direction.
